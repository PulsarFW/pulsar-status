## Overview

Registers `plsr.Status`, read/written through `Get`/generic status keys (`PLAYER_THIRST`, `PLAYER_HUNGER`, etc). Ticks hunger/thirst/stress down over time and applies real gameplay effects at low values (sprint disabled, camera shake, death risk at zero thirst). Drunkenness and oxygen are separate tracked statuses with their own effects. `server/registerItems.lua` wires the items that restore each status — this is the system `pulsar_inventory`'s `statusChange` item field talks to.
